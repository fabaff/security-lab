Fedora Security Lab Test bench
------------------------------

The Fedora Security Lab Test bench provides a save environment for
security auditing and testing and can be used for teaching security
testing methodologies. At the moment the focus lies on web applications.
All application are running on top of a current Fedora installation with
a ​Lighttpd webserver and a ​MySQL server. 

The Fedora Security Lab Test bench includes:

* Vulnerable web applications (DVWA, bWAPP, SQLI Labs, and SQLol)
* Shells (PHP Shell, ​b374k, ​Ani-Shell, and ​WSO PHP Shell)
* ​Helper tools (PHP Shell detector, ​linfo, and ​phpmyadmin) 

All applications are directly accessible from a bootstrap-based website. 

The 'test-bench' directory contains everything that is needed by Ansible 
to configure a bare Fedora installation as FSL Test bench.

The FSL Test bench repository contains a subset of playbooks from the 
fedora-ansible git repository maintained by Fabian Affolter. This repo is
located at https://github.com/fabaff/fedora-ansible.
